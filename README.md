# GenoMaker
Declarative language for complex genomic analysis

## Introduction
GenoMaker is a declarative, data-driven, human-readable language to express complex interval operations in genomic analysis. Some of the features it provides are:

- Reading genomic intervals from tabular files into frame-like structures;
- Performing all common interval operations (bedtools-style);
- Associating quantitative values to intervals (e.g. ChIP-Seq signals);
- Integrating different data types;
- Performing computations on the values associated with intervals (e.g. differential analysis, correlations).

## Availability
GenoMaker is under active development, the first version will be released soon.
